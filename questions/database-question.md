where area >3000000 or population > 25000000

```


## Problem 2


X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the moviesâ€™ ratings and descriptions.
Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.

For example, table cinema:
```

+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```
For the example above, the output should be:
```
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```
## Answer for problem 2

```
select * from cinema where (id mod 2 = 1) and description != "boring" order by rating desc

```


## Problem 3


Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
```

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```
For the example above, the output should be:
```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```
## Answer for problem 3

```
select case
    when mod(id,2) != 0 and id = (select max(id) as sid from seat)  then id  
    when mod(id,2) != 0 then id+1
    else id-1 end as id, student
from seat
order by id

```

## Problem 4

Table: Person

```

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```
Table: Address
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
```

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State
## Answer for problem 4

```
select FirstName, LastName, City, State
from Person left join Address
on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
;

```

## Problem 5

Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

```

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:
```
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```


## Answer for problem 5

```
select Email from
(
  select Email, count(Email) as num
  from Person
  group by Email
) as statistic
where num > 1
;

```

## Problem 6

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```

+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):


```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```


## Answer for problem 6

```
SELECT Scores.Score ,COUNT(DISTINCT greater.Score)+1 AS Rank
FROM Scores
LEFT JOIN Scores greater ON greater.Score>Scores.Score
GROUP BY Scores.Id
ORDER BY Rank
;

```
